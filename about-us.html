    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Sac Tabla Maker is a home-based tabla-making service proudly located in Sacramento, California. The idea began when we noticed a lack of accessible tabla making and reheading services in the local community, leaving many people without reliable support. Inspired by friends who share a deep love for playing tabla—and who faced the same challenges—we took the initiative to respond to that need. What started at home in March 2025 began with offering free tablas to the local Sikh community. The overwhelmingly positive feedback and encouragement that followed gave us the confidence to turn our passion into a business. Today, we provide finished puddas and duggas, professional reheading services, custom orders for custom-scaled tablas, and minor repairs to improve sound quality. Built on love for seva (selfless service) and community, Sac Tabla Maker continues to grow with the support of over 800 followers on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sac_tabla_maker/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet" target="_blank">@sac_tabla_maker</a>.</p>
